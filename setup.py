    AsanaToGithub copies your tasks from an Asana project to your Github repository's issue tracker. It copies Asana task title, notes, comments and attachments to Github issues. It supports UTF-8 encoding.

    Asana task's title and note is created as Github issue. The comments and attachments of the task are added as a comment to the Github issue. AsanaToGithub supports linking the Asana task and Github issue together by means of adding links in the comments at both sites.

    Features
    --------
    #. You can copy incomplete and completed tasks.
    #. Tasks can be copied in batch or interactively. 
    #. You can copy Asana comments and attachments to the Github issue which can be disabled.
    #. A comment is added to Asana task which has link to the Github issue. This can be disabled.
    #. After copy, tag and labels are applied to the Asana task and Github issue respectively. This too can be disabled.
